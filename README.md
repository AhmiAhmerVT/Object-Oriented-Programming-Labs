## Project Overview

A C++ console animation that prints "AHMER NAVEED ABBASI" and "FOUNDATION UNIVERSITY" using stars (*).
Each letter is drawn through custom functions with cursor positioning and timed animation.

## How It Works

1. Uses gotoxy() for cursor movement and Sleep() for animation delay.
2. Each alphabet has its own function.
3. Main functions print the name and university step by step.

## Requirements

1. Windows OS
2. Any C++ compiler
3. gotoxy.h file in the same folder
4. How to Run
5. Place gotoxy.h with this code.
6. Compile and run the program.
